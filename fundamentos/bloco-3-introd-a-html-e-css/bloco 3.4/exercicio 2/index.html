        <h2>technical stuff:</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Odontodactylus scyllarus</em>, or mantis shrimp, are carnivorous marine crustaceans of the order
          <em>Stomatopoda</em>, branching
          from other members <br>
          of the class <em>Malacostraca</em> around 340 million years ago. The Mantis shrimp typically grow to around 10
          cm
          (3.9 in) in length,
          <br> while a few can reach up to 38 cm (15 in), they belong to the <em>arthropoda</em> phylum and
          <em>crustacea</em> sub-phylum. They belong to the <em>animalia</em> kingdom, in case you didn't know.
        </p>
        <p>
          About 450 species of mantis shrimp have been discovered worldwide; all living species are in the suborder
          <em>Unipeltata</em>, which arose around 193 million years ago.
        </p>

          ... Called "sea locusts" by ancient Assyrians, "prawn killers" in Australia,[5] and now sometimes referred to
          as
          "thumb splitters"—because of the animal's ability to inflict painful wounds if handled incautiously[6]—mantis
          shrimp have powerful raptorials that are used to attack and kill prey either by spearing, stunning, or
          dismembering. Some mantis shrimp species have specialised calcified "clubs" that can strike with great power,
          while others have sharp forelimbs used to seize the prey (hence the term "mantis" in its common name).

            <h3>where do they live?</h3>
            <p>
              The mantis shrimp lives in <strong>warm, shallow water</strong>, and typically grows to be between 6 - 12
              inches (15, 30 cm) in
              lenght

            <p>
              Aquariums don't typically house mantis shrimps because they tend to <strong>slaughter</strong> every other
              creature they share
              a
              tank with.

            <h3>they have very fast movements</h3>
            <p>
              Their limbs move so quickly the water around them boils in a process know as <em>supercavitation</em>.
              When
              these cavitation bubbles<br>
              collapse, it produces an <strong>undersea shockwave</strong> that can kill prey even if the mantis shrimp
              misses its target.
